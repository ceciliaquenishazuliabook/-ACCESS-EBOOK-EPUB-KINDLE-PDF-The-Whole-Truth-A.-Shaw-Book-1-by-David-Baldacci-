Title: Relevant to the World Today
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2018
Review: A small group of people manipulate the world into believing that the Russians did a bad thing by using fake news articles, the internet and the media to spread the lies.
I think Mr. Baldacci may be clairvoyant.
Now I see where the DNC got its ideas from.
(Please don't be offended by this humorous observation.)
The book was great. Fast paced and cannot put down.
I will read the next Shaw book and expect that it will be just as good.

Title: Lots Of Action
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020
Review: I really liked The Whole Truth. David Baldacci is a great writer who produces one interesting story after another. A. Shaw is a new character in his books and a very exciting one. There is lots of action. Shaw is a sympathetic killer who works for a secret agency of our government. Most of the book takes place in Europe. His true love is killed by a fiendish bad guy who likes to stir up wars so he can sell weapons.
A female free lance newspaper writer who has a drinking problem joins Shaw in pursuit of the bad guy. A very action filled page turner.

Title: Did It Again
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2021
Review: David Baldacci it definitely my summer, fall, winter and spring read. His characters have a moral compass that so many are missing in 2021. People need to stop thinking only about their wants and have to haves and begin thinking about their fellow human beings. Yes inhabitants of this world. If we don‚Äôt and still continue on our selfish path things might end differntly.

I would love to hear more about the lives of Shaw, Katie James, et al. Just like I wanted more about Decker his crew and all of the amazing characters that Mr Baldacci writes about. They are what we need and how generations were taught to behave, morally.

Title: A SPLENDID READ!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2015
Review: David Baldacci spins a great yarn as most of us have come to understand, but in The Whole Truth, he reaches heights unknown before. This is a thoroughly exciting tale, and he comes at you with twists and turns and redirection that leaves you panting to keep up. I've read a lot of suspense, including many of Mr. Baldacci's works, and never did I expect to find such brilliance in this story when I began reading it. It's a thriller, it's a most touching love story involving people who should be immune from that malady. Baldacci takes all of these elements and weaves a story that I will remember for a long time to come. The man's mind must work at warp speed...........it's an amazing read.

Review: Really like Baldacci‚Äôs books! Interesting story line from start to finish. This was another that had me in its grip till the last. Now I‚Äôve got to see if there‚Äôs another of this line. With the way it ended there has to be.

Title: The Whole Truth will thrill you and scare you!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2014
Review: Baldacci tells stories that are believable, yet improbable to happen as see depicts. That is why his story is so compelling! The reader gets drawn in to the mixture of a love story, political debauchery, and redemption as only Baldacci can. It has heroism, suspense, opulence, and people committing all the Seven Deadly Sins! Shaw, the main character is out for justice, but not before he and his friend Katie,the journalist face extreme danger with dire consequences for so many. A first class read for those who root for good to overcome evil, even though the good guys have flaws of their own nd a broken and dark past. A real winner you do not want to miss. I am convinced the book is not really fiction , only that the names have been changed to protect the GUILTY!

Title: Very Modern Topic
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2021
Review: If this story didn't contain so much violence, I'd suggest the book be required reading in every high school. Do NOT simply believe everything in print. Fact check, people. On top of the timely theme, this book is a great read. I couldn't put it down.
